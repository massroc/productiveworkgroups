# Script for populating the database. You can run it as:
#
#     mix run priv/repo/seeds.exs
#
# Inside the script, you can read and write to any of your
# repositories directly:
#
#     ProductiveWorkgroups.Repo.insert!(%ProductiveWorkgroups.SomeSchema{})
#
# We recommend using the bang functions (`insert!`, `update!`
# and so on) as they will fail if something goes wrong.

alias ProductiveWorkgroups.Repo

# Seed the Six Criteria Workshop template
# This will be implemented when the Workshops context is created
